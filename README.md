# Langmuir Science Models

Two main tasks are considered in this project:
1. Demonstrating science model's ability to correctly extract plasma parameters from enviromental data (either synthetic or real)
2. Creating and obtaining data to test models with

## Demonstrating Science
Matlab is the primary language used for examining LP data and extracting plasma parameters using analytical models

## Data Creation Methods
Data used for scientific models is obtained in a variety of ways:
1. Matlab
2. LTSpice
3. NASCAP
4. Other LP data

### Matlab 
Matlab synthetic data is created by defining parameters for temperature and density, then using analytical models to define expected collected currents.

### LTSpice
Data from LTSpice is taken from analog models coded into spice 

### NASCAP
Nascap is used to create SC models and test data in different environments

### Other LP data
Data sets from other successful LP missions is also included
